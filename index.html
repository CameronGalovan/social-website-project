    <h1>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a pretty weird guy, so here is a wonky list of some of my interesting
      tastes.
    <hr /></p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p class="center">
      <img src="IMG/musicnote.png" alt="music" width="600px" />
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE Music. I play piano, I sing in a choir, and I listen to it on a
      regular basis.
    </p>
    <p class="center"><img src="IMG/piano.jpg" alt="piano" width="500px" /></p>
    <h3>PIANO</h3>
    <p>
      On piano, I play a variety of songs, mainly from my piano book or scores
      of video games and movies. I've played piano since 2016 and have loved it
      ever since.
    </p>
    <p class="center"><img src="IMG/choir.webp" alt="choir" width="400px" /></p>
    <h3>CHOIR</h3>
    <p>
      I sing with
      <a href="https://www.edmontonyoungvoices.ca/" target="_blank"
        >EYV Choirs</a
      >, a wonderful choir where I have expanded my knowledge of music greatly
      and made great friends. Next July, we're taking a tour to Europe through
      Frankfurt, Prague, Vienna, and Salzburg. We mainly sing classical type
      music and obscure carols for our Christmas concert.
    </p>
    <h3>LISTENING TASTE</h3>
    <p class="center">
      <img src="IMG/SMGmusic.jpg" alt="Supermariogalaxy" width="200px" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The music I mainly listen to is from video games, such as Super Mario and
      the Legend of Zelda. The instrumental themes in video games really appeal
      to me because they bring out a sense of environment and emotion that is
      very important with music. Plus, given that this music is designed to be
      played in the background of games for hours on end, it takes a long while
      to get bored of one particular song. Some of my favourites include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Main Theme of "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
      <li>Jump Up, Super Star! from Super Mario Odyssey</li>
      <li>"Rauru's Theme" from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
      <li>"Gusty Garden Galaxy" from Super Mario Galaxy</li>
      <li>"Ballad of the Goddess" from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</li>
      <li>"Escape from the City" from Sonic Adventure 2</li>
      <li>The Main Theme of "Wii Sports Resort"</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2 class="gamer">Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      I spend a majority of my free time either watching or playing video games.
      Here are some of my favourite individual games and franchises.

      <img src="IMG/betterbook.png" alt="books" height="200px" />
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to read! I reread a lot of books and remember much of most of them,
      so do not challenge me to Harry Potter Trivia. Some of my favourite books
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)" target="_blank"

    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="music">Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As stated above, I quite like playing music and video games,
       as well as reading books.
       Here's a couple more things I do in my free time.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Youth Activities- I am very involved in my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (click <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng"> here</a> to learn more) I volunteer quite a bit with them, and participate in activities on Wednesday evenings. The Church also organizes the second largest food drive in Edmonton, collaborating with the Edmonton Food bank every September.</li>
        <li>I enjoy socializing with my friends, some from school, some from church, and some from choir and extracurriculars. Hanging out with them is an oppurtunity I rarely pass up.</li>
      <li>I spend a little bit of time a week cooking. Over the summer, I cooked one meal a week for my family, as did my three siblings, so I've become pretty good at that.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="center"><img src="IMG/cookies.jpg" alt="cookies" height="100px"></p>
      <hr>
    <h2 class="gamer">Places</h2>
      <p class="center"><img src="IMG/InkedMap_of_USA_with_state_names_.jpg" alt="USA" width="600px"></p>
      <p>I'm not the most well traveled person,
         but not being native to Canada,
          I have been through many of the States,
           with my extended family living mostly in Utah
 and my dad's education taking us to Missouri years ago.
 In 2018, my whole family flew to California to accompany my dad to his work conference,
  which he skipped much of to go to 
        Disneyland, Legoland, Sea World, and the San Diego Zoo.</p> 
      <p>When my family isn't traveling to Utah to visit family,
       one of our more common trips we take is to Montana to
      visit Glacier National Park. The mountains in that area are gorgeous,
       and the woods and wildlife bring the area to life.</p>
       <p class="center"><img src="IMG/Jasper.jpg" alt="Jasper" width="400px"></p>
       <p>My favourite place in Alberta is Jasper National Park. My family loves
        hiking, and one of the hikes in Jasper we do most frequently there is the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/alberta/valley-of-the-five-lakes-loop">Valley of the Five Lakes</a>
        (click link to see), a beautiful hike that takes you around, you guessed
        it, five lakes, all with different shades and vistas.
       </p>
       <hr>
       <h3 class="bookie">Travel Bucket List</h3>
       <p>Given that I haven't been to too many places,
         there is a variety I would like to go to.</p>
         <ul>
<li>Italy- I love pizza and pasta, and I think eating it in the native country would be really cool.</li>
<li>Denmark- <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-ca">LEGO</a> was basically my whole childhood, so I would love to see all the attractions in Billund.
  Copenhagen is also an amazing physics college, a field I am very interested in for a future career.</li>
<p class="center"><img src="IMG/lego.jfif" alt="LEGO"></p>
<li>Japan- Much of the media I consume daily comes from Japan, be it
  Nintendo games, manga, or something in between, there's many things there that interest me.</li>
<li>Scotland- Pictures of Scotland with the lochs and mountains there
  look very majestic, and I am a sucker for folk music with instruments like
  fiddles and bagpipes.
</li>
         </ul>
         <hr>
         <h2 class="bookie">Influential people in my life</h2>
<p>Given that they raised me, my parents would obviously be the first people on this list.
  They taught (and still teach) me to be a kind, productive person, and because I 
  was homeschooled for the past 8 years, they played a major part in my 
  education as well.
</p>
<p>Several other family members have helped me become who I am today. My 
  older sister Brooke has fueled my love for music through her example, my younger brother Andrew is always
  someone I can hang out with, and my little sister Hannah exemplifies kindess.
  My grandparents are also awesome, always suppourtive and kind when I need them.
</p>
<p>Various other people such as teachers have nourished and grown my talents.
  both my piano and choir teachers help me to be better at my talents and encourage me along the way.
</p>

<h2 class="music">Potential Career Plans</h2>
<p>
When I was a bit younger, my dream job was to be a LEGO designer, and although that would still be fun, 
google says it does not pay very well and so woudln't be the best option for me.
Currently, it is my aspiration to become a physicist. What kind, I 
haven't decided yet, as all apects of physics interests me, but I love the idea of 
making monumental discoveries in the history of humanity. My dream colleges for this
include Yale, MIT, Copenhagen, and Cambridge, as they have rich scientific histories 
and would likely give me vast oppurtunites (so a high grade on this project would be nice ;)

<hr />
<h2 class="gamer">Journal/blog section</h2>
<p>In this section I will detail what I did the day before I wrote this (Sep 14), and what a normal day looks life for me.</p>
<h4>Normal day</h4>
<p>On an average weekday, I wake up. Pretty self explanitory, I know. 
  But here's the thing: I wake up at 5:45am, just to get to a church class called seminary. In it, my class, my teachers, and I study the scriptures and interpret them to get messages from them.
  After seminary, I hurry home to eat a small breakfast, prepare my lunch for school, and catch the bus. I go to school, have english and computer
  science (where I am doing this assignment), and then eat lunch with friends. 
  I then go to math and social studies, walk home, and do my daily chores, eat dinner, and then
  go to various extracurricular activities, such as piano, choir, and youth.
</p>
<h4>September 14, 2023</h4>
<p>I woke up, although with a bit of trouble, and hastily got ready for seminary, not being able to find some stuff.
  My mom drove me, my sister, and a couple of our friends to the church building, where we went our seperate ways and had
  our lessons. I came home and made a small sandwich, with little breakfast, and raced to catch the 
  bus with Brooke. After getting into school I greeted my friends in English class,
  where we first read a book for 15 minutes, and then watched Edward Scissorhands (which we are going to analyze)
  I walked a few meters to computing science, where I submitted my first porject to github and worked on this one while
  I waited for it to get into the system.</p><p>After eating lunch with a few of my friends and doing some math homework, I walked to math, where
  we studied factoring polynomials and got our test results from Tuesday. I then went to social studies,
  where we studied the digital divide and how technology affects globalization. After walking home, I watched the Nintendo Direct and got very excited for 
  some new announcements. Having done that, I had neglected to prepare myself a dinner to eat after my piano lesson, so I quickly composed a
  sandwich.</p> <p>I went to piano, practiced with my teacher, and then walked a short distance to the church where my choir
  is held. As it was the first rehearsal of the school year, we spent quite a bit of time
  getting to know new people and choosing some very pretty songs for our Christmas performance,
  including Carol of the Bells in Ukranian (I believe it is called Sce Drk), and a wonderful
  a capella piece called Sleep. I arrived home at around 9:30 pm, texted with a couple friends, took care of compost and 
  recycling, showered, and went to bed.
